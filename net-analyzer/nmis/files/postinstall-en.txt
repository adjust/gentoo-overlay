INSTALLATION

The ebuild installs most parts of nmis automatically, but
you will have to create a database for the nmis event records.

Note: You may use either MySQL or PostgreSQL based on the respective USE flag
enabled during build time. PostgreSQL is not supported by upstream.

== Instructions for MySQL:

You can do this using the following commands as the mysql root user:

> mysql -u root -p -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS nmis;
                       CREATE DATABASE nmis;
                       GRANT CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON nmis.* TO 'nmis'@'localhost'
                       IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
                       FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

Please do not forget to choose a password that is more sensible than 'pass' ;)

Now as user "nmis":

> mysql -u nmis -ppass nmis < ${MY_SQLSCRIPTSDIR}/mysql/${PV}_create.sql

You also need to set the MySQL password for the nmis user in the
${MY_HOSTROOTDIR}/conf/nmis.conf file so that nmis can access the database.

You may want to edit your MySQL configuration as per upstream recommendations.
See /usr/share/doc/${PF}/my.cnf.example for reference.

== Instructions for PostgreSQL:

1. Create nmis user & database:

> psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER nmis WITH PASSWORD 'pass'
> createdb -E LATIN1 -l C -T template0 -U postgres -O nmis nmis

Please do not forget to choose a password that is more sensible than 'pass' ;)

2. Now as user nmis, create database tables:

> env PGPASSWORD='pass' psql -U nmis -d nmis -f ${MY_SQLSCRIPTSDIR}/postgres/${PV}_create.sql

You also need to set the PostgreSQL password for the nmis user in the
${MY_HOSTROOTDIR}/conf/nmis.conf file so that nmis can access the database.
Additionally you need to set "sqldrv=Pg" and configure sqlhost and sqlport
accordingly so that nmis can access the database.

Now you can go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} and use the
application.
