Ever want a primary key where you can have one value for each of true, false,
or null?  Where null is distinct for this purpose?  For boolean values
ajbool provides this.  It is useful where a boolean is a part of a primary key,
and where for each key, only one value can be null.

When casting from bool, null becomes 'u' (for unknown) and when casting to
bool, 'u' becomes null.
