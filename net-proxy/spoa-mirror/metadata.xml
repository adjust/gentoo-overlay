		Replicating (mirroring) HTTP requests using the HAProxy SPOP, i.e. Stream
Processing Offload Protocol.

This is a very simple program that can be used to replicate HTTP requests
via the SPOP protocol.  All requests are replicated to the web address (URL)
selected when running the program.

The program originated from a test program located in the contrib/spoa_example
directory.  spoa.c is an original program that comes with HAProxy source.

The program uses the libev event library, as opposed to the original program
that uses the libevent library.
